While developing a React Native application using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server would intermittently fail to start, throwing an obscure error message related to WebSockets.  The error message itself wasn't very helpful and didn't point to a clear cause, such as a specific port conflict or network issue. The problem was inconsistent, sometimes working fine, sometimes failing without a clear pattern.
