The solution involved identifying and terminating any processes that might be using the ports required by the Expo development server, especially around the WebSockets port range (typically 19000-19005).  On Linux/macOS, the `lsof -i :19000` command can be used to find processes using those ports. On Windows, use Resource Monitor. Once identified, terminate these processes before restarting the Expo development server. If this doesn't work, specifying an explicit port with the `--port` flag in the expo start command might be needed. For example:

```bash
expo start --port 20000
```
This ensures that your Expo server uses a port that is not in conflict with other applications.
